## 1. Problem Statement

What problem are we solving and why now?

## 2. Target Users

Who benefits and how?

## 3. Goals

- Goal 1 (measurable)
- Goal 2 (measurable)

## 4. Non-Goals (Explicitly Out of Scope)

- What we are NOT doing

## 5. User Stories

Each user story includes inline acceptance criteria.

### US-1: <Story title>
**As a** [role], **I want** [action], **so that** [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC 1.1: <testable condition>
- [ ] AC 1.2: <testable condition>

### US-2: <Story title>
**As a** [role], **I want** [action], **so that** [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] AC 2.1: <testable condition>
- [ ] AC 2.2: <testable condition>

## 6. Functional Requirements

### Must Have (P0)

### Should Have (P1)

### Nice to Have (P2)

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (Consolidated)

Master checklist of all acceptance criteria for easy reference and tracking.

### P0 — Must Pass for Launch
- [ ] AC 1.1: <from US-1>
- [ ] AC 2.1: <from US-2>

### P1 — Should Pass
- [ ] ...

### P2 — Nice to Have
- [ ] ...

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- Performance
- Security
- Scalability
- Accessibility

## 9. Testing Strategy

Define required test types per user story. These override/extend the project defaults in `pipeline.config.yaml`.

| User Story | Unit | Integration | UI | E2E | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----|-----|-------|
| US-1 | Yes | Yes | No | No | <reason> |
| US-2 | Yes | No | Yes | No | <reason> |

## 10. Technical Context & Constraints

- System dependencies, API limits, existing architecture

## 11. Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|--------------------|
| Metric 1 | target value | how measured |
| Metric 2 | target value | how measured |

### Tracking & Analytics Events

Define events needed to measure the success metrics above. If no client-side tracking is needed, state "N/A — metrics measured server-side / via existing dashboards."

| Event Name | Trigger | Properties | Maps to Metric |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------------|
| feature_viewed | User opens feature page | user_id, timestamp | Metric 1 |
| action_completed | User completes key action | user_id, duration_ms, result | Metric 2 |

> **PII note:** Do not include personally identifiable information (emails, names, IPs, phone numbers) in event properties. Opaque user IDs and session IDs are acceptable.

## 12. Open Questions

- [ ] Unresolved decision 1
- [ ] Unresolved decision 2

## 13. Dependencies & Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Risk 1 | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low | Mitigation strategy |

## 14. Timeline Estimate

- Phase 1: ...
- Phase 2: ...
