# Pipeline Configuration Template
# Copy this file to your project root as `pipeline.config.yaml` and customize.

pipeline:
  # Project type flags — enable conditional critic agents
  has_frontend: false            # Set true for projects with frontend code (enables Designer Critic)
  has_backend_service: false     # Set true for long-running services: API servers, workers, queue consumers (enables Observability Critic)
  has_api: false                 # Set true for projects exposing or consuming HTTP/GraphQL/gRPC APIs (enables API Contract Critic)
